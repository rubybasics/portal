Sigh, lost a lot of notes b/c I stupidly didn't commit them >.<

Here are some I had on a paper
* Link to standards
* Group questions together
* Track wrong answers
* Allow student to request "more like this", "ask me again"
* Students can make their own quizzes

Also, there are a few more notes about this from my 1on1 with Jeff
